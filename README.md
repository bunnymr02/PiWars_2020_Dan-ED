# PiWars_2020_Dan-ED
Lego based robot competing in PiWars 2020.  The robot looks like WALL-E, but is completely unique, using a Raspberry Pi as a controller.  It can be remotely driven using a gamepad controller, but also incorporates line followers, ultrasonic distance sensors, plus camera based machine vision to support autonomous piwars challenges.
